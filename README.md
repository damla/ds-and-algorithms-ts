## Data Structures and Algorithms

### Fundamental Data Structures:
- [ ] **Arrays:** 
   - Understand how arrays work, how to access, insert, and delete elements.
   - TypeScript allows you to work with arrays easily, e.g., `let arr: number[] = [1, 2, 3];`

- [ ] **Linked Lists:** 
   - Learn about singly and doubly linked lists, how to insert, delete, and traverse them.
   - Implementing a linked list class in TypeScript can be a good exercise.

- [ ] **Stacks:**
   - Understand the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle.
   - Create a Stack class in TypeScript with methods like push, pop, peek.

- [ ] **Queues:**
   - Understand the FIFO (First In First Out) principle.
   - Implement a Queue class in TypeScript with methods like enqueue, dequeue.

### Advanced Data Structures:
- [ ] **Trees:** 
   - Learn about binary trees, traversal methods, AVL trees, and Red-Black trees.
   - Implement these trees and their balancing algorithms in TypeScript.

- [ ] **Heaps:**
   - Understand min-heaps and max-heaps, and how to insert and delete elements.
   - Implement a Heap class in TypeScript.

- [ ] **Hash Tables:**
   - Learn about hashing, collision resolution strategies.
   - Create a Hash Table class in TypeScript.

- [ ] **Graphs:**
   - Understand different representations of graphs (adjacency matrix, adjacency list) and basic graph algorithms.
   - Implement graph representation and traversal algorithms in TypeScript.

## Algorithms:

- [ ] **Sorting and Searching Algorithms:**
   - Study and implement common algorithms like QuickSort, MergeSort, Binary Search in TypeScript.

- [ ] **Dynamic Programming and Divide-and-Conquer Algorithms:**
   - Understand the principles behind these algorithmic paradigms and solve problems using them.
   
- [ ] **Graph Algorithms:**
   - Implement Breadth-first Search, Depth-first Search, and Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm in TypeScript.
