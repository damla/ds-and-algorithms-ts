# Linked Lists

- Linked lists are used in various real-world applications due to their dynamic memory allocation and ease of insertion and deletion compared to arrays. Here are some scenarios where linked lists are utilized:

1. **Dynamic Memory Allocation:**
   - Linked lists are useful in environments where memory is fragmented or limited, and dynamic allocation is preferred over pre-allocated memory like arrays.

2. **Implementation of Other Data Structures:**
   - Linked lists serve as the foundational building blocks for several other data structures including stacks, queues, deques, and adjacency lists for representing graphs.

3. **Real-Time Applications:**
   - In real-time systems, where execution time is crucial, linked lists can be useful due to their quick insertion and deletion times compared to the time it takes to resize an array.

4. **Undo Functionality:**
   - Applications like text editors or systems that require an undo functionality can use a linked list to keep track of operations. Each node can represent a state or a set of changes.

5. **Music Playlists:**
   - Linked lists can be used to create music playlists where each node represents a song and has pointers to the next and previous songs, mimicking the functionality of a Doubly Linked List.

6. **Browser History:**
   - Browsers can use linked lists to implement backward and forward navigation of web pages.

7. **Pagination:**
   - In applications where data is paginated, a linked list can keep track of pages and navigate through them in a forward or backward manner.

8. **File Systems:**
   - Linked lists can be used in file systems to keep track of files in directories, where each node represents a file and contains a pointer to the next file in the directory.

9. **Memory Management:**
   - In memory management, free blocks of memory can be managed using linked lists where each node represents a block of free memory and points to the next free block.

10. **Garbage Collection:**
    - In languages with garbage collection, linked lists can be used to keep track of objects to be garbage collected.

11. **Networking:**
    - Linked lists can be used in network routing tables to handle routing paths dynamically.

12. **Order Processing:**
    - In order processing systems, linked lists can be used to manage the order processing queue, allowing for efficient additions and removals.

## Understanding Linked Lists

1. **Components:**
   - **Node:** The fundamental unit of a linked list. Each node contains a value and a reference to the next node.
   - **Head:** The first node in the linked list.
   - **Tail:** The last node in the linked list, which points to `null` or `undefined`.

2. **Types of Linked Lists:**
   - **Singly Linked List:** Each node points to the next node.
   - **Doubly Linked List:** Each node points to both the next node and the previous node.
   - **Circular Linked List:** The last node points back to the first node.
