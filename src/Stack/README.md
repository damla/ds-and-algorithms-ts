# Stacks

- Stacks are fundamental data structures and are used in various real-world applications:

1. **Call Stack in Programming Languages**:

   - When a program executes, it keeps track of function calls using a stack known as the call stack. Each function call creates a new frame on the stack which holds the local variables and other information for that call. When the function returns, its frame is popped from the stack.

2. **Expression Evaluation and Syntax Parsing**:

   - Stacks are used in algorithms that evaluate expressions (e.g., evaluating postfix expressions) or parse syntax (e.g., checking for balanced parentheses in code).

3. **Undo Operations**:

   - Many software applications, like text editors and graphical editors, keep a stack of operations that have been performed so that they can support undo operations.

4. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:

   - In graph algorithms like depth-first search, a stack can be used to keep track of the vertices that need to be explored.

5. **Backtracking Algorithms**:

   - Stacks are used in backtracking algorithms to keep track of the current state and backtrack when necessary (e.g., solving a maze, the N-Queens problem).

6. **Memory Management**:

   - Stack-based memory allocation is a simple and efficient memory management scheme that allocates memory in a Last-In-First-Out manner.

7. **Browser's History**:

   - Web browsers keep track of the pages you've visited using a stack. Each new page you visit is pushed onto the stack, and the back button pops the current page off the stack to display the previous one.

8. **Virtual Machines and Runtime Environments**:

   - Stacks are used in virtual machines and runtime environments to execute code. For instance, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) has a method execution stack.

9. **Recursive Algorithms**:

   - Recursive algorithms inherently use a stack to keep track of the recursive calls, with each call creating a new frame on the stack.

10. **Assembly Language and System Programming**:
    - Low-level system programming often involves direct manipulation of the stack to handle function call mechanics and low-level memory management.
