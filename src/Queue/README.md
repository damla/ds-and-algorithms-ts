# Queue

- Queues are linear data structures that follow the FIFO (First In First Out) principle. This means that the element that is added first will be removed first.

1. **Task Scheduling**:

   - In operating systems, tasks are often managed in a queue for processing based on their arrival time.

2. **Order Processing**:

   - In order processing systems, orders are placed in a queue for processing in the order they were received.

3. **Print Queue**:

   - In networked environments with many users needing to print documents on a single printer, the order of printing is typically managed using a queue.

4. **Customer Service**:

   - In customer service scenarios, incoming requests or calls are held in a queue until they can be directed to the next available customer service representative.

5. **Data Buffering**:

   - Queues are used in scenarios where data is transferred asynchronously between two processes. For example, IO Buffers, pipes, file IO, etc.

6. **Traffic Management**:

   - In network routing, queues are used to manage the packets of data waiting to be forwarded or processed.

7. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:

   - In graph algorithms like Breadth-First Search, a queue is used to keep track of the vertices that need to be explored.

8. **Simulation and Modeling**:

   - Queues are used in simulation and modeling, for example, to model the real-world flow of queues such as lines at a grocery store, vehicles at a toll booth, etc.

9. **Online Sale Systems**:

   - During online sales or ticket booking, the requests are held in a queue for processing to manage the high volume of requests and provide fair access.

10. **Real-Time Systems**:

    - In real-time systems, tasks are often managed in a queue based on their priority or arrival time, ensuring timely processing.

11. **Message Queues**:

    - In distributed systems, message queues are used to manage the communication between different parts of a system.

12. **Batch Processing**:
    - Queues are used in batch processing to manage the tasks waiting to be processed.
